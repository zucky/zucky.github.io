# Avataaars
#### Designed by: Pablo Stanley | Developed by: Johnny Rodriguez

Avataaars is a the **most robust** component for generating profiles or avatars. You can use it for your product, for fun, for personas, for team pages, or just for fun!

You can mix & match hairstyles, accessories, clothing, eye expressions, mouths, skin color, and even graphics on t-shirts.

> **Note:** There are over **11** dropdowns and overrides that you can use to mix and match.
