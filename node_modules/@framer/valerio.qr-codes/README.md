Based on the [qrious](https://github.com/neocotic/qrious) NPM package, from Framer you can adjust:
- **Value:** the content of the qr code, it's just some text!
- **Level:** the error correction level of the QR code (L, M, Q, H)
- **Foreground:** the color of the QR code itself
- **Background:** the color of the background

# Usage

Simply drop the component in your canvas, wrap it in a Frame if you need to make it interactive via link tool.
